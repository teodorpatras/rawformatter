# Privacy Policy
Your data always belongs to you, and only you. RawFormatter does not collect any data.

## How your data is protected and used
- By default, RawFormatter does not send any data to our servers or any third parties. All your data is processed and stored locally on your device. 
- When processing a page, RawFormatter needs to inject temporary data into the page to render it accurately. When using RawFormatter in Chromium-based browsers, websites can fetch resources declared in the "web_accessible_resources" section of the manifest.json file. Because of this, a website may be able to detect you are using RawFormatter.

## Customer support
When you request for customer support, we may ask for your email address to get back to you.
